Source code and data set that analyzes headlines for book entitled <em>Outliars.</em>

<em>Outliars</em> considers how headlines of the Trump era negotiated the fact of lying. It takes as its data set a 28-year 
archive of headlines* from The New York Times, arguably the most popular coverage of U.S. politics in the last four years. 

By comparing recent coverage to historical coverage, the book looks at how the transition from print to digital has influenced the quantity and types of content that are published in The New York Times. This includes a tabulation of Trump coverage compared to past presidents—dating back to Bill Clinton when the Times’s website was first introduced.
